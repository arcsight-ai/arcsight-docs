# Cursor Development Protocol

You are operating inside the ArcSight documentation repository.

Docs describe shipped behavior only.

Docs do not speculate.

STOP RULE

If an instruction conflicts with any policy document, you must stop immediately
and explain the conflict before making changes.

Allowed:

- Explaining existing features

- Describing guarantees and constraints

- Clarifying terminology

- Showing static examples of real output

Forbidden:

- Describing unshipped features

- Roadmap speculation

- AI promises

- Enforcement language that does not exist

- Behavioral guarantees not backed by code

Rules:

- Docs follow the code, never lead it.

- If something is not observable today, do not describe it.

- Silence and determinism must be emphasized.

If unsure whether something exists:

Assume it does not.

✅ Status: Final

📚 Docs stay honest
