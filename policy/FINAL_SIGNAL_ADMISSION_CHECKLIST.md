# Final Signal Admission Checklist

A signal may appear in ArcSight's default summary only if all are true:

- [ ] Provable via language semantics or structural graphs

- [ ] Irreversible without code change

- [ ] Structurally permanent (not contextual or temporal)

- [ ] Language-scoped (not ecosystem or framework-based)

- [ ] Safe to suppress when uncertain

- [ ] Requires no explanation or interpretation

- [ ] Introduces no ranking, scoring, or prediction

If any box is unchecked, the signal must NOT enter the default summary.
