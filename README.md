# ArcSight Documentation

Welcome to the ArcSight project documentation. This repository contains comprehensive documentation for the ArcSight system architecture, development phases, and migration strategies.

## Documentation Index

### Core Architecture Documents

1. **[Strategic Architecture](./01-decision-phase1-vs-phase2.md)**  
   Phase 1 vs Phase 2 structure decision — when to stay separate vs migrate to monorepo

2. **[Physical Architecture](./02-phase1-folder-scaffold.md)**  
   Phase 1 folder scaffold — where code lives and architectural boundaries

3. **[Operational Architecture](./03-full-system-roadmap.md)**  
   Full system roadmap — what to build, when, and in what order (CTO sign-off)

4. **[Layered Usage Model](./04-usage-model.md)**  
   How documents 1, 2, and 3 work together — which document to use when

### Supporting Documents

5. **[Monorepo Migration](./05-monorepo-migration.md)**  
   Strategy and guide for migrating to a monorepo structure

6. **[Dependency Contract](./06-dependency-contract.md)**  
   Dependency management and contract specifications
