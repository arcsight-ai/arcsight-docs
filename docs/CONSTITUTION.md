# ArcSight Constitution

## Definition

- ArcSight exists to replace uncertainty about architectural impact with evidence.

## Canonical Certainty Gaps

- Structural
- Semantic
- Temporal
- Epistemic

- Any signal must reduce exactly one of these. Otherwise it is out of scope.

## What ArcSight Reports

- Provable
- Irreversible
- Explanation-free
- Safe to suppress

## What ArcSight Will Never Do

- Rank
- Score
- Recommend
- Predict
- Judge quality
- Explain risk

## Silence

- Silence means no provable architectural certainty gap exists.

## Expansion Rule

- ArcSight may expand only by detecting new certainty gaps, never by adding advice or interpretation.

## Governance

- Changes require founder sign-off. No exceptions.
